# Getting Started

This is a live real-time cryptocurrency price tracker that uses the Messari.io API for data and updates every 5 seconds.  You will need to signup for an API key in order to use the Messari API.

In the project directory for client, you can run:

```sh
npm start
```

This starts the client app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:19000](http://localhost:19000) to view it in the browser.

In the project directory for server, you can run 

```sh
npm start
```

This starts the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will need a way to test the app in a simulator or on your mobile device.  I use [Expo](https://expo.dev/).
